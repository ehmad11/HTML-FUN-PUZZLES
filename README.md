# HTML FUN PUZZLES

It was an academic project developed by me in the last decade rediscovered recently from an old backup CD and now uploaded here as an archive.

## Basic Idea

Idea of the game is simple, sort HTML tags in correct order. Each tag and tutorial will also have explanation about itself.
